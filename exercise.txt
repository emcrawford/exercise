## What are the differences between push, pull, and fetch?
## 
## - `git fetch` - gets changes from a remote repository into your tracking branch
## - `git push` - sends changes from a local branch to a remote repository
## - `git pull` - gets changes from a remote branch into your tracking branch and
##                merge them into a local branch
## 
## Use `git fetch` to simply replicate remote changes to your local branch. This will succeed if a tracking branch for a remote repository is connected to it.
## 
## Use `git push` to "Make the remote branch resemble my local branch."  If a tracking branch for a remote repository has been specified, current changes in your branch are pushed to the remote branch.
## Your push will fail if the remote branch has diverged from your local branch. If this happens, synchronize your local branch with the remote branch by using git pull or git fetch and git merge.
##
## Use `git pull` to update both your tracking branch and local branch by invoking `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
##  - Remote changes fetched into your tracking branch.
##  - Merge changes from your updated tracking branch into your local branch, often called the 'Master'.
##
## 'git pull' is often preferred for speed and efficiency, but manually performing 'git fetch' and then performing 'git merge' only when you have understood the changes being incorporated into your local branch is recommended when caution is appropriate.
