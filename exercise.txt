## What is the difference between push, pull, and fetch?
## 
## - `git fetch` - gets changes from a remote repository into your tracking branch
## - `git push` - sends changes from a local branch to a remote repository
## - `git pull` - gets changes from a remote branch into your tracking branch and
##                merge them into a local branch
## 
## Use `git fetch` to simply replicate remote changes to your local branch. This will succeed if a tracking branch for a remote repository is connected to it.
## 
## Use `git push` to "Make the remote branch resemble my local branch."  If a tracking branch for a remote repository has been specified, current changes in your branch are pushed to the remote branch.
## Your push will fail if the remote branch has diverged from your local branch. If this happens, synchronize your local branch with the remote branch by using git pull or git fetch and git merge.

`git fetch` again takes our current branch, and checks to see if there is a tracking branch. If so, it looks for changes in the remote branch, and pulls them into the tracking branch. It does not change your local branch. To do that, you'll need to do `git merge origin/master` (for the "master" branch) to merge those changes into your branch - probably also called "master".


## Use `git pull` to update both your tracking branch and local branch by invoking `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
##  - Remote changes fetched into your tracking branch.
##  - Merge changes from your updated tracking branch into your local branch, often called the 'Master'.


is kes our current branch, and checks to see whether or not there is a tracking branch for a remote repository connected to it. If so, our changes are taken from our branch and pushed to the remote branch. This is how code is shared with a remote repository, you can think of it as "make the remote branch resemble my local branch". This will fail if the remote branch has diverged from your local branch: if not all the commits in the remote branch are in your local branch. When this happens, your local branch needs to be synchronized with the remote branch with git pull or git fetch and git merge.
## keep `git pull` does two things. 
## `git fetch` again takes our current branch, and checks to see if there is a tracking branch. If so, it looks for changes in the remote branch, and pulls them into the tracking branch. It does not change your local branch. To do that, you'll need to do `git merge origin/master` (for the "master" branch) to merge those changes into your branch - probably also called "master".`git pull` simply does a `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`. This is often what we desire to do, but some people prefer to use git fetch followed by git merge to make sure they understand the changes they are merging into their branch before the merge happens.
